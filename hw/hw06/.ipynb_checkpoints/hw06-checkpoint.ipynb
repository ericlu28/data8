    "No, simulation is not the best way to give us the probability that the monkey will type \"Data 8\". Based on data_chance, the theoretical probability of this event occuring is less than 1/10^10, meaning that to achieve this theoretical probability experimentally, one would need to run 10^10 simulations many, many times. This is incredibly computationally expensive, with regards to the problem, and it is why simulation is not the best technique."

For example, Al Horford scored an average of 5.2 points for 3 pointers and free throws combined, and has a salary of **\\$28 million.** This is equivalent to 280 thousands of dollars, so his value is $\\frac{5.2}{280}$.

    "The range of values in question 3 better predict the distribution of the population's player values from 0 to 0.3. From 0 to 0.3, the Percent per Points per Thousands of Dollars column heights of the 50 player sample size is almost identical to that of the overall distribution of all NBA players. Furthermore, in the bin from 0.5 to 0.6 in the sample, the percent is much migher than the bin from 0.4 to 0.5. That difference is not depicted similarily in the overall distribution of the population's player values. Finally, a sample will better depict a population near the center (mean/median) of the data. The farther away from the center the data is, the less likely the sample can depict that distribution as accurately. Clearly, the majority of the data lies in the bin from 0 to 0.3, so the plot in question will better depict those values."

In sample2, the earthquakes are sorted by their magnitude in descending order, meaning that taking a sample of the first 100 rows of this sorted earthquakes table will yield the 100 strongest earthquakes. Clearly, that will not be representative of all of the earthquakes. In sample2, the table is ordered based on the date that the earthquake was recorded in descending order. By taking a sample of the first 100 rows of the earthquakes table, sample2 will include the last 100 earthquakes in the year. If in 2019, the earthquakes at the end of the year were much weaker than the beginning of the year, the sample mean would not be representative. In this case, the mean of sample2 will likely be closer to the population than sample1's mean, however, neither are that representative of the population."

    "You cannot accurately use a sample of size 200 to determine the maximum. The problem with using the maximum as the estimator is that the maximum of the population is a value that is not close to the rest of the distribution. Sampling is accurate to determine population values like mean and median that are representative of the entire distribution. Based on the histogram, the maximum itself could potentially be an outlier. That is why sampling to find the maximum is not the most ideal choice."
